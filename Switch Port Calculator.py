# -------------------------------------------------- Changelog --------------------------------------------------
#
# 02-Jan 2019: Created base code with basic calculations and program flow control.
#              Program still require input verification and automatic (x) variable calculation
#              Varaibles need to be updated to camel case.
#
# 03-Jan 2019: Removed "b" input an replaced with b = x * 0.2 for the 20% allowance. Left input statement for future changes.
